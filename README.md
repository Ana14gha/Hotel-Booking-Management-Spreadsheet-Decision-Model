# Hotel Paradise Booking Management Model

## Project Overview (Spreadsheet Modelling, Scenario Analysis, Business Analytics)
This project develops a spreadsheet-based decision model to help Hotel Paradise manage bookings more effectively and maximise profits during peak seasons.  
It brings together scenario analysis, profitability forecasting, and risk assessment to test different pricing strategies, manage operational costs, and optimise revenue from both reservations and walk-ins.  

By combining real-world booking patterns with financial simulations, the model allows decision-makers to see not just “how much” they might earn, but also how stable and reliable those profits are under different operating conditions.

## What the Model Does
- Tracks daily bookings, cancellations, expenses, and walk-ins to provide a full picture of hotel operations.
- Compares the financial impact of two main pricing strategies: $200/night and $250/night.
- Calculates key metrics such as occupancy rate, daily profit, walk-in revenue, and total operational costs.
- Identifies which pricing strategy delivers the most stable and profitable results across varying scenarios.
- Helps managers understand the trade-offs between attracting more guests at a lower rate versus maximising profit per booking.

## Key Insights
- The **$250/night** rate consistently generates higher profits during peak demand, with a strong balance between growth potential and risk.
- The **$200/night** rate is effective in off-peak periods, helping boost occupancy when demand is softer.
- Profitability improves when daily expenses are kept under control and walk-in guest numbers increase.
- Small operational changes — such as reducing late cancellations or increasing walk-in traffic — can have a significant impact on overall profit.
- Recommended strategy: **Dynamic pricing** — $250 in high demand, $200 in low demand, supported by continuous monitoring.

## Why It Matters
Hotels face constant pressure to optimise room rates without alienating potential guests. This model gives hotel managers a clear, data-driven way to balance occupancy and profitability.  
By running realistic “what if” scenarios, they can see how different rates, costs, and guest behaviours influence the bottom line — helping them avoid guesswork and make confident, strategic decisions year-round.  
The result is not just better pricing but smarter operations that adapt to changing demand.
