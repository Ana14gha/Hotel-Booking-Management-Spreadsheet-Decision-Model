# Hotel-Booking-Management-Spreadsheet-Decision-Model
A spreadsheet-based decision model designed to improve hotel booking management and maximise peak season revenue.   The model uses deterministic and stochastic inputs, scenario analysis, and risk assessment to evaluate the impact of different room rates, expenses, and guest behaviours.

## Model Features
- **Inputs:**
  - Stochastic: daily reservations, late cancellations, miscellaneous expenses, walk-ins (modelled with Poisson distributions)
  - Decision variables: room rate, late cancellation fee
  - Fixed: number of rooms, housekeeping cost, promotions
- **Calculated Outputs:** occupancy rate, daily profit, revenue from walk-ins, total costs

## Analysis Approach
- Compared $200 and $250 room rate scenarios
- Assessed the impact of daily miscellaneous expenses on profit
- Modelled walk-in guest variations
- Performed descriptive statistics on simulated outputs
- Conducted risk analysis to identify profit stability and growth opportunities

## Key Findings
- The $250 rate provided higher and more consistent profits with lower risk of losses
- Profitability improved with controlled expenses and increased walk-ins
- Risk analysis showed stronger stability for the $250 rate, especially during peak demand
- Recommended dynamic pricing â€” $250 in peak periods, $200 off-peak

## Skills Demonstrated
- Spreadsheet modelling and scenario analysis
- Application of probability distributions for business forecasting
- Risk and profitability analysis
- Data-driven pricing strategy recommendations
